            My love, my love<br> 
            It's a lie, a lie<br> 
            I catch you every time<br> 
            In your lies, your lies<br> 
            Every time you close your eyes<br>

            Those guys, those guys<br> 
            You told me that you left it all<br> 
            Behind, behind<br> 
            It's a lie, a lie<br> 
            I catch you every time<br>
